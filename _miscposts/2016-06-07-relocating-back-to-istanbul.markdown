After staying in Switzerland for a little bit more than 5 years, it is time to move on. We decided that we'd like to go back to Turkey.

<!--more-->

Our one-way flight is at the end of this month, June.

Biggest reason for this decision is our desire to have our son next to his grandparents and other family members.
Other than that, 5 years is enough!

There were good things and bad things in Switzerland. There will be good things and bad things in Turkey. However, we're super happy to go back home!

August 1st 2016 is the day I start my new job in Istanbul. ...an awesome job BTW. Details later.
