August 1st 2016 will be my first day at Red Hat!

<!--more-->

As I wrote in [my relocation to Istanbul](2016-06-07-relocating-back-to-istanbul.html), I start a new
job in Istanbul.

I will join Red Hat mobile team. I will work on
[Red Hat Mobile Application Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform).


I am really excited about this!

I will be working remotely in Istanbul, so I will be at home a lot. However, I am planning to be a very
active member of the dev communities in Turkey (probably after 6 months or so, since I will focus on learning stuff)

Wanna meet? Just [let me know](https://twitter.com/aliok_tr).
