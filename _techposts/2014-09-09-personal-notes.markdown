I love Jekyll and Github pages. My blog is based on those two. I decided to use them to take notes as well.
It is easy to write, accessible everywhere, safe and versioned.

Before I was using Apple's *Notes* application. That was good already: saving to cloud, searching, formatting, etc.
However, I hate copy pasting things in that application. Formatting is aweful and you have to click around too many times to fix it.
Other downsides are it is using a cloud service from Apple -which I don't like the idea-;
you cannot make your notes public; you cannot easily access them anywhere else.

But, with Jekyll and Github pages:

* My notes are safe on Github
* I can access my notes everywhere as it is just public and online
* It is so easy to write something down with Markdown syntax (I use Kramdown btw)
* My writings are versioned and I can check history any time I want
* It is Git! Easy to maintain.
* Prepare stuff while offline.

This is also much better than Evernote or something similar as I often note code fragments.

Downside is that one shouldn't write private stuff there. Well, this is no problem for me as I have another mechanism for that.

My notes are available at <http://personalnotes.aliok.com.tr> .
