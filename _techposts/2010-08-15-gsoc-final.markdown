Google Summer of Code ends tomorrow and I tagged my work during the GSoC period.
<!--more-->

The project website is deployed to <http://people.apache.org/~aliok/GSoC/tagged/html5-comp-lib-project/target/site/index.html>

The result of evaluations is not announced yet, but I am happy since I think I made a good progress anyway.
I'll continue to work on the Html5 support at MyFaces.

GSoC was a great opportunity for me and I think I didn't blow it :

* Became a Apache MyFaces committer,
* Learnt both great technical stuff and gained open-source how-to
* Met with good people
* Will speak at JavaOne with my mentor, Matthias Wessendorf (if I don't have trouble getting the visa for US)
and I think I found the job at Innflow and will be relocated to Switzerland by this project too.


So, thanks Google, Apache Software foundation, Matthias and my family.
