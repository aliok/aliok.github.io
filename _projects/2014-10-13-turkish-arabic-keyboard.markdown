Turkish people were using an Arabic-script based alphabet until 1928. Government decided to migrate to a new latin-script based alphabet that time.
I built a Windows keyboard layout which is for Arabic-script based alphabet.

It mimics the latin-based Turkish Q keyboard layout for Windows.

Even though I am a Mac user, unfortunately Mac keyboard is not very convenient for this purpose. Thus when I need to use this layout I just
  switch to my virtual Windows instance and use it there.

Here are the keyboard states:

### No modifier

### `shift`

### `alt-gr (ctrl+alt)`

### `shift + alt-gr (ctrl+alt+shift)`
